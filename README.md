## Configuration Files

- **.bash_profile**: My custom bash profile with CLI coloring and support for RVM and NVM, git branch parsing, and git auto complete. You must place `git-completion.bash` in your home directory (~/) for git-completion.bash to work.
- **.gitconfig**: My custom .gitconfig with preferred command aliases and coloring.
- **git-completion.bash**: A custom bash script for auto completion of local and remote git branches, tags, file names, and file paths.
